# Search GitHub Repositories - REACT.JS application

Project developed during classes at Bootcamp Hiring Coders 3 VTEX, from Gama Academy.

## The Application ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄ

Fundamental concepts of React were approached through the construction of a simple and functional application.

![The initial screen of the application, in which the search for the Github user takes place.](./src/images/search_repository.PNG 'The initial screen of the application, in which the search for the Github user takes place.')

![The screen where the searched users' repositories are displayed.](./src/images/repository.PNG "The screen where the searched users' repositories are displayed.")

The concepts covered were:

- Hooks;
- Components;
- Properties;
- State;
- Routes (with react-router-dom);
- Requests to external APIs (with express);
- Events;
- Styling (with styled-components);
- Handling errors and user experience.

## Running the application

On the homepage, the user enters a GitHub username. The application, in turn, searches for that user, retrieves its repositories and displays them on another page.

## To Run the application

Just run the following commands in the project root:

```
npm install
npm start
```
